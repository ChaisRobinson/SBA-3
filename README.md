Single-Page Web Application
This is a small single-page web application created as part of a technical assessment. The application demonstrates various web development concepts and techniques, including DOM manipulation, event handling, form validation, and user interaction.

Description
The application is designed to showcase the implementation of the following requirements:

Caching elements using getElementById and querySelector/querySelectorAll
Navigating the DOM using parent-child-sibling relationships
Iterating over a collection of elements
Creating elements using createElement
Adding elements to the DOM using appendChild and/or prepend
Using DocumentFragment or HTML templating with cloneNode
Modifying HTML or text content of elements in response to user interaction
Modifying styles and CSS classes of elements in response to user interaction
Modifying attributes of elements in response to user interaction
Registering event listeners and creating associated event handler functions
Using Browser Object Model (BOM) properties or methods
Implementing form and input validation using HTML attributes and DOM events
Ensuring error-free execution of the program
Committing frequently to the git repository
Getting Started
To run the application locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository: git clone <https://github.com/ChaisRobinson/SBA-3>
Open the index.html file in a web browser.
Usage
The application provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the implemented features. Users can navigate through the application, fill out forms, and observe the dynamic behavior of the elements in response to their actions.

Development
The application is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It leverages various web development techniques to achieve the desired functionality.

During the development process, frequent commits were made to the git repository to track progress and maintain version control.

Reflection
Developing this single-page web application provided valuable insights into the process of creating a functional and interactive user experience. It allowed for the exploration and application of various web development concepts and techniques.

The project emphasized the importance of meeting the minimum requirements before expanding on additional features. This approach ensures a solid foundation and helps in understanding the scope and timeline of the development process.

User experience played a crucial role in the design and development of the application. By considering the user's perspective, efforts were made to create an intuitive and enjoyable interaction with the application.

Overall, this project served as a practical exercise in applying web development skills and techniques to create a functional and engaging single-page web application.
